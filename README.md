# ML-based Page Replacement System

This project implements a reinforcement learning (DQN) based page replacement algorithm to minimize page faults in a virtual memory system.

## Instructions
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Train the model: `python src/train.py`
3. Test the model: `python src/test.py`
